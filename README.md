## Variational Quantum Eigensolver 

This repository concerns with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The implementation of VQE is provided in the file VQE.ipynb. Additionally, we discuss the application of VQE for finding the roots of equations.

## Problem statement

In this repository, we use the VQE to find the roots of two quadratic equations: $x^2-2x+1$ and $x^2-4x+4$.

## Result

We have used the VQE to estimate the roots of the equations $x^2-2x+1$ and $x^2-4x+4$. The estimated values for the roots are 0.9999999999999984 and 1.9999999999999998, respectively.
